# React-native-app

A react native template with bunch of settings for a code ready project.

### App icon setup

This project uses the react-native-make library to setup app icon without hassle.

```bash
  yarn add @bam.tech/react-native-make -D
```

After installing the library the image needs to be in png/jpeg format and 1024x1024 minimum size.

Then run the following command:

```bash
  yarn react-native set-icon --path [path-to-image] --background color
```

For platform specific setup
